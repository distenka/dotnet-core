## ðŸš€: Get Started

Check `/src/Templates/samples/` **SubscriptionServiceProcessor** example processor
- ```dotnet add package Distenka --version 1.0.0```

- It includes processes for managing subscriptions and bank accounts, such as creating, modifying, activating, and deactivating subscriptions, as well as adding and validating bank accounts.

### Prerequisites
- .NET 6.0 or later
- SQL Server (or your database of choice)
- Configure the database connection in appsettings.json or via environment variables

### Setting Up the Database
- Update the connection string in appsettings.json or set it via environment variables.
- Example (appsettings.json):
json

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=dbName;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  }
}
```

### Running Processes
The project uses the Distenka framework to manage and execute processes. Below are the key CLI commands for interacting with the processes.

To see all registered Processes in the application, run:

```
dotnet run -- list
```

This will display a list of process names, such as `SubscriptionServiceProcessor.CreateSubscriptionProcess`, etc.

To see what the config file looks like, simply generate a JSON file for the process. run

```
dotnet run -- get "SubscriptionServiceProcessor.CreateSubscriptionProcess" CreateSubscriptionProcess.json
```
Here is the output file

```
{
  "userId": 0,
  "planId": 0,
  "process": "SubscriptionServiceProcessor.CreateSubscriptionProcess"
}
```

to run process locally 

```
dotnet run -- run "CreateSubscriptionProcess.json" "createSubscriptionProcess-results.json"
```
